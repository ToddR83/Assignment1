            <h4>About Todd Raymond</h4>
            <!--Bio-->
            <p>
                During high-school, during that time when everyone asks you the same question "What do you want to be?", I had a few ideas of what I would like to do.  One of my interests being video games I thought
                I would like to get into the field of creating them.  Unfortunately there were many at that time that had very strong opinions about the gaming industry.  After listening to family, friends and school
                guidance councilors I shied away from this field.  Instead I played to what was my greatest strength at the time, Customer Service.  I started out where most at my age did, McDonalds.  I was very quickly
                promoted as both customers and superiors respected the work I was doing.  Since that time I have managed two other stores at different locations in Canada, each time moving to a position with more
                responsibility but always a focus on customer satisfaction as this has been a strong suit for me from the beginning.<br />
                <br />
                Through all of this, no mater where I was or what was happening in my life, I found myself thinking back to high-school and wishing I had taken the chance despite the risks.  So a few years ago I decided
                that it was time for me to take the risk.  To do what feels right.  I enrolled at Georgian College in the Computer Programmer course to start me on the journey that will eventually land me where I want
                to be.  A Game Developer.
