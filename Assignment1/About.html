    <!--Bio-->
    <p>During highschool, during that time when everyone asks you the same question "What do you want to be?", I had a few ideas of what I would like to do.  One of my interests being video games I thought
    I would like to get into the field of creating them.  Unfortunatly there were many at that time that had very strong opinions about the gamming industry.  After listening to family, friends and school
    guidence counclors I shied away from this field.  Instead I played to what was my greatest strength at the time, Customer Service.  I started out where most at my age did, Mcdonalds.  I was very quickly
    promoted as both customers and superiors respected the work I was doing.  Since that time I have managed three stores at different locations in Canada, each time moving to a position with more 
    responsability but always a focus on customer satisfaction as this has been a strong suit for me from the beginning.<br />
    <br />
    Through all of this, no mater where I was or what was happening in my life, I found myself thinking back to highschool and wishing I had taken the chance dispite the risks.  So a few years ago I decided
    that it was time for me to take the risk.  To do what feels right.  I enrolled at Georgian College in the Computer Programmer course to start me on the journey that will eventually land me where I want
    to be.  A Game Developer.
