    <!--Personal Tagline-->

    <h2>Computer Programmer extraordinaire! I create video games using C#, Unity, Java, HTML, CSS,JavaScript and JQuery.</h2>
    
    <p>
        While growing up, I, much like any other youngling, loved to play video games.  As time progressed I found that games became easier and seemingly less original.  At first I dismissed this,
        thinking that it was a natural progression of my growing talent for games.  A time came when I realized that perhaps there was more to it, that maybe there was room for change in the gamming
        industry, that if there were changes to be made I would endevor to find them and be a part of this new era of gamming.<br />
        <br />
        I have always felt that the AI was too predictable in video games.  When I decided to get into programming I was not 100% sure what my end goal would be.  After studying for a time at school and
        really thinking about what I want to do, I have realized that I want to create more robust AI systems.  AI systems that do not feel robotic but instead feel organic, fluid....Alive...<br />
        <br />
        Technology is moving forward with incredible speed.  With all the new technologies availiable and those that are at the cusp of our understanding, I believe that video games are about to take the next
        step in their eveolution and I intend to be apart of this.
