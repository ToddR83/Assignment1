            <p>
                While growing up, I, much like any other child, loved to play video games.  As time progressed I found that games became easier and seemingly less original.  At first I dismissed this,
                thinking that it was a natural progression of my growing talent for games.  A time came when I realized that perhaps there was more to it, that maybe there was room for change in the gaming
                industry, that if there were changes to be made I would endeavor to find them and be a part of this new era of gaming.<br />
                <br />
                I have always felt that the AI was too predictable in video games.  When I decided to get into programming I was not 100% sure what my end goal would be.  After studying for a time at school and
                really thinking about what I want to do, I have realized that I want to create more robust AI systems.  AI systems that do not feel robotic but instead feel organic, fluid....Alive...<br />
                <br />
                Technology is moving forward with incredible speed.  With all the new technologies available and those that are at the cusp of our understanding, I believe that video games are about to take the next
                step in their evolution and I intend to be apart of this.
